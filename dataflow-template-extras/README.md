# A Cookie Cutter Template Project for DataFlow pipelines

### Expectations
The scripts in this template expect that you have
* pyenv installed 
* poetry installed
* You have a global python interpreter that has cookiecutter installed
* Runs only on linux machines for now (because scripts use bash)

### Preface
* This is the very first iteration for the cookiecutter template. So, it may have some problems. Anyways, we will iteratively fix it to enhance the quality. 
* The main purposes of this template is to
    * minimize the overhead when setting up a new project
    * standardize the project structure

### How it's designed
It's designed to suit our workflows as outlined in Notion.
